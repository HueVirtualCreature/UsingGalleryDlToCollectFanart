# Installation
Run the installer, read carefully.

# Usage
After installation, if you have a twitter link in your clipboard, running ClipboardToGalleryDl.exe will automatically download the media of said post into the directory you specified during installation.
The downloads will autmatically follow the format path/gallery-dl/twitter - username.
It will download images, videos, and series of images.

# Hotkeys
You can streamline the process of downloading images if you set up some sort of hotkey for copying a tab's URL and opening ClipboardToGalleryDl.exe.

# Disclaimer
Gallery-dl, Twitter, and any other site that this could work on could change at anytime and is completely out of my control. I can try to update this when such a situation occurs. Just log an issue and I will take a look.

Additionally, this tool could potentially be used to download a LOT of images in bulk (data mining; hoarding content). This may cause you to be rate limited. Regardless, I strongly advise against using the tool in this way for ethical reasons. This tool is just meant to help out vtubers with a lot of fanart and who need a way to manage that content in an organized manner.

That said, gallery-dl is the real meat of the download functionality and is freely available, regardless of my contributions. And at the end of the day, no one can stop you from just spending the time to manually right click > save as.
